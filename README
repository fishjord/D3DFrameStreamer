DirectX Streamer is designed to facillitate streaming frames from DirectX 9/10/11 applications over a socket.

The program comes in three parts:
  1. A utilitiy program to inject the dll in to the directx application
  2. The injected code (based heavily on spazzarama's Direct3DHook)
  3. A wrapper around ffmpeg to transcode and stream over tcp
  
Right now only directx 9 applications are supported, the other versions just need to have their code updated to use a more efficent screen grab than the slow to-bitmap that was originally used in the Direct3DHook application (d3d9 has surface blt which I'm used to using, also most of the programs I particularly wanted to use this with are d3d9).

The frame server sends raw image data encoded as argb32 over a tcp socket to an end point defined by the injecting application at a maximum specified framerate.

The ffmpeg wrapper is a small python script that can run on the same machine or a seperate machine that handles transcoding (curretly configured to transcode to h264 in an mpeg2 ps).

I am happy to answer questions about the code but it still very much a WIP and not a one-click solution.
